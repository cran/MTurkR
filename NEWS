### CHANGES TO MTurkR 0.2 ###

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES ##
* A completely new GUI interface for managing MTurkR, which now suggests library(tcltk), has been added. The previous, text-based wizard remains available by calling mturkr.wizard("simple").
* Support for ReviewPolicies has been added, both creating them using GenerateReviewPolicy() and retrieving their results using GetReviewResultsForHIT().
* Support for AnswerKey data structures has been added, for use in CreateQualificationType().
* Added simple checks for 'sortproperty', 'sortdirection', 'pagesize', and 'pagenumber' parameters in relevant functions.
* Expanded support for QuestionForm data structures is currently under development and should be available in the next release.

## BUG FIXES ##
* A number of bug fixes have been corrected throughout the package. Most were minor and related to output, but some like the 'return.all' parameter in GetAssignments(), were producing unintended behavior.
* Various mislabelled function parameters (used within functions) have been corrected (some were creating notes on R CMD check).
* request() was modified to remove problematic whitespace characters when writing log entries (which made reading the log file into R problematic).

## DOCUMENTATION ##
* Fixed a number of minor errors in documentation.
* Expanded documentation for functions associated with AnswerKey and ReviewPolicy data structures.
* Expanded documentation for 'sortproperty' and 'sortdirection' parameters in relevant functions.
