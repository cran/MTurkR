\title{Register a HITType}
\description{Register a HITType on MTurk, in order to create one or more HITs to show up as a group to workers.}
\usage{
RegisterHITType(title, description, reward, duration, keywords = NULL, 
				auto.approval.delay = NULL, qual.req = NULL, 
				keypair = credentials(), print = TRUE, browser = FALSE, 
				log.requests = TRUE, sandbox = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{title}{A character string containing the title for the HITType. All HITs of this HITType will be visibly grouped to workers according to this title. Maximum of 128 characters.}
  \item{description}{A character string containing a description of the HITType. This is visible to workers. Maximum of 2000 characters.}
  \item{reward}{A character string containing the per-assignment reward amount, in U.S. Dollars (e.g., \dQuote{0.15}).}
  \item{duration}{A character string containing the amount of time workers have to complete an assignment for HITs of this HITType, in seconds (for example, as returned by \code{\link{seconds}}). Minimum of 30 seconds and maximum of 365 days.}
  \item{keywords}{An optional character string containing a comma-separated set of keywords by which workers can search for HITs of this HITType. Maximum of 1000 characters.}
  \item{auto.approval.delay}{An optional character string specifying the amount of time, in seconds (for example, as returned by \code{\link{seconds}}), before a submitted assignment is automatically granted. Maximum of 30 days.}
  \item{qual.req}{An optional character string containing one or more QualificationRequirements data structures, for example as returned by \code{\link{GenerateQualificationRequirement}}.}
  \item{keypair}{A two-item character vector containing an AWS Access Key ID in the first position and the corresponding Secret Access Key in the second position. Set default with \code{\link{credentials}}.}
  \item{print}{Optionally print the results of the API request to the standard output. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{browser}{Optionally open the request in the default web browser, rather than opening in R. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
  \item{log.requests}{A logical specifying whether API requests should be logged. Default is \code{TRUE}. See \code{\link{readlogfile}} for details.}
  \item{sandbox}{Optionally execute the request in the MTurk sandbox rather than the live server.  Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\details{All HITs of a given HITType are visibly grouped together for workers and share common properties (e.g., reward amount, QualificationRequirements). This function registers a HITType in the MTurk system, which can then be used when creating individual HITs. If a requester wants to change these properties for a specific HIT, the HIT should be changed to a new HITType (see \code{\link{ChangeHITType}}).

\code{hittype()} is an alias.
}
\value{A character string containing the HITTypeId of the newly registered HITType.}
