\title{Contact Worker(s)}
\description{Contact one or more workers. This sends an email with specified subject line and body text to one or more workers. This can be used to recontact workers in panel/longitudinal research or to send follow-up work. Most likely will need to be used in tandem with \code{\link{GrantBonus}} to implement panels.}
\usage{
ContactWorker(	subjects, msgs, workers, batch = FALSE, keypair = credentials(), 
				print = FALSE, browser = FALSE, log.requests = TRUE, sandbox = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{subjects}{A character string containing subject line of an email, or a vector of character strings of of length equal to the number of workers to be contacted containing the subject line of the email for each worker. Maximum of 200 characters.}
  \item{msgs}{A character string containing body text of an email, or a vector of character strings of of length equal to the number of workers to be contacted containing the body text of the email for each worker. Maximum of 4096 characters.}
  \item{workers}{A character string containing a WorkerId, or a vector of character strings containing multiple WorkerIds.}
  \item{batch}{A logical (default is \code{FALSE}), indicating whether workers should be contacted in batches of 100 (the maximum allowed by the API). This significantly reduces the time required to contact workers, but eliminates the ability to send customized messages to each worker.}
  \item{keypair}{A two-item character vector containing an AWS Access Key ID in the first position and the corresponding Secret Access Key in the second position. Set default with \code{\link{credentials}}.}
  \item{print}{Optionally print the results of the API request to the standard output. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{browser}{Optionally open the request in the default web browser, rather than opening in R. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
  \item{log.requests}{A logical specifying whether API requests should be logged. Default is \code{TRUE}. See \code{\link{readlogfile}} for details.}
  \item{sandbox}{Optionally execute the request in the MTurk sandbox rather than the live server.  Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\details{
Send an email to one or more workers, either with a common subject and body text or subject and body customized for each worker.

In batch mode, workers are contacted in batches of 100. If one email fails (e.g., for one worker) the other emails should be sent successfully. That is to say, the request as a whole will be valid but will return additional information about which workers were not contacted. This information can be found in the MTurkR log file, or by calling the request with \code{browser=TRUE} and viewing the XML responses directly.

\code{ContactWorkers()} and \code{contact()} are aliases.
}
\value{A dataframe containing the list of workers, subjects, and messages, and whether the request to contact each of them was valid.}
