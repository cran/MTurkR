\title{Approve Assignment(s)}
\description{Approve one or more submitted assignments, or approve all assignments for a given HIT or HITType. Also allows you to approve a previously rejected assignment. This function spends money from your MTurk account.}
\usage{
ApproveAssignment(	assignments, feedback = NULL, rejected = FALSE, 
					keypair = credentials(), print = FALSE, browser = FALSE, 
					log.requests = TRUE, sandbox = FALSE)

ApproveAllAssignments(	hit = NULL, hit.type = NULL, feedback = NULL, 
						keypair = credentials(), print = FALSE, 
						log.requests = TRUE, sandbox = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{assignments}{A character string containing an AssignmentId, or a vector of multiple character strings containing multiple AssignmentIds, to approve.}
  \item{hit}{A character string containing a HITId all of whom's assignments are to be approved.}
  \item{hit.type}{A character string containing a HITTypeId all of whom's HITs' assignments are to be approved.}
  \item{feedback}{An optional character string containing any feedback for a worker. This must have length 1 or length equal to the number of workers. Maximum of 1024 characters. For \code{ApproveAllAssignments}, must be length 1.}
  \item{rejected}{A logical indicating whether the assignment(s) had previously been rejected (default \code{FALSE}). Approval of previously rejected assignments must be conducted separately from other approvals.}
  \item{keypair}{A two-item character vector containing an AWS Access Key ID in the first position and the corresponding Secret Access Key in the second position. Set default with \code{\link{credentials}}.}
  \item{print}{Optionally print the results of the API request to the standard output. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{browser}{Optionally open the request in the default web browser, rather than opening in R. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
  \item{log.requests}{A logical specifying whether API requests should be logged. Default is \code{TRUE}. See \code{\link{readlogfile}} for details.}
  \item{sandbox}{Optionally execute the request in the MTurk sandbox rather than the live server.  Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\details{
Approve assignments, by AssignmentId (as returned by \code{\link{GetAssignment}} or by HITId or HITTypeId. Must specify \code{assignments} xor \code{hit} xor \code{hit.type}. \code{ApproveAllAssignments} approves all assignments of a given HIT or HITType without first having to perform \code{\link{GetAssignment}}.

\code{ApproveAssignments()} and \code{approve()} are aliases for \code{ApproveAssignment}. \code{approveall()} is an alias for \code{ApproveAllAssignments}.
}
\value{A dataframe containing the list of AssignmentIds, feedback (if any), and whether or not each approval request was valid.}
