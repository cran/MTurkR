\usage{
RejectAssignment(	assignments, feedback = NULL, 
					keypair = credentials(), print = TRUE, browser = FALSE, 
					log.requests = TRUE, sandbox = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{assignments}{A character string containing an AssignmentId, or a vector of multiple character strings containing multiple AssignmentIds, to reject.}
  \item{feedback}{An optional character string containing any feedback for a worker. This must have length 1 or length equal to the number of workers.}
  \item{keypair}{A two-item character vector containing an AWS Access Key ID in the first position and the corresponding Secret Access Key in the second position. Set default with \code{\link{credentials}}.}
  \item{print}{Optionally print the results of the API request to the standard output. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{browser}{Optionally open the request in the default web browser, rather than opening in R. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
  \item{log.requests}{A logical specifying whether API requests should be logged. Default is \code{TRUE}. See \code{\link{readlogfile}} for details.}
  \item{sandbox}{Optionally execute the request in the MTurk sandbox rather than the live server.  Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}

\code{RejectAssignments()} and \code{reject()} are aliases.
}
